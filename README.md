Displays geological observation sites around the village of Keyworth, UK. 

Information for each observation site can be accessed by simply clicking on the marker icons.

A single click anywhere on the map will return the latitude/longitude position at that point. This may be useful for planning future observation site locations.

Selected soil maps (and their associated legends) can be viewed by selecting them using the button to the top right of the screen. Note that you may need to zoom in to allow these additional layers to render. On selecting either the *Soil grain size* or *Soil group* maps, you can add place and street name labels by ticking the *Add labels* box. To return to the default map at anytime, select *Overview (default)* and untick the *Add labels* box.

The complete source code can be accessed by following the App Source Code hyperlink at the bottom of the page.
