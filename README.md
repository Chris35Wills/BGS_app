# Geospatial Application: Visualisation of geological observations and soil conditions

Displays geological observation sites around the village of Keyworth, UK. 

The application can be accessed at: [https://chris35wills.github.io/BGS_app/](https://chris35wills.github.io/BGS_app/)

Information for each observation site can be accessed by simply clicking on the marker icons.

A single click anywhere on the map will return the latitude/longitude position at that point. This function may be useful for planning future observation site locations.

Selected soil maps (and their associated legends) can be viewed by selecting them using the button to the top right of the screen. Note that you may need to zoom in to allow these additional layers to render. On selecting either the *Soil grain size* or *Soil group* maps, you can add place and street name labels by ticking the *Add labels* box. To return to the default map at any time, select *Overview (default)* and deselect the *Add labels* box. These additional layers are available courtesy of the [British Geological Survey](http://bgs.ac.uk/).

## Issues and further development

Please log any issues or ideas for further development [here](https://github.com/Chris35Wills/BGS_app/issues).

## Preprocessing 

There is also a Python data preprocessing script available [here](https://github.com/Chris35Wills/BGS_app/blob/gh-pages/misc/preprocessing.py). This has been used to standardise all data prior to it being presented - see the file header for more info.
